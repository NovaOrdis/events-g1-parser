A Java Virtual Machine garbage collection log parser. It processes garbage collection logs and
turns them into time series events that can be further processed or correlated with other
events generated by complex systems.

Usage:

    gc [command [command-options]] [query] <gc-log-file.log>

The default command displays the garbage collection event stream, as extracted from the log.
The output command accepts standard output options, as described here:

    -o property-name|property-index
